# Angi Controller Practical
A simple K8s Operator for deploying PodInfo with a backing Redis Cache

## Description
The Operator watches the MyAppResource CR, which looks like:
```
apiVersion: my.api.group/v1alpha1
kind: MyAppResource
metadata:
  name: whatever
spec:
  replicaCount: 2
  # i changed the spec here to match k8s conventions
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 100m
    limits:
      memory: 64Mi
  image:
    repository: ghcr.io/stefanprodan/podinfo
    tag: latest
  ui:
    color: "#34577c"
    message: "some string"
  redis:
    enabled: true
```

And maps those settings into fields within [PodInfo](https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo) and [Redis](https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo) Deployments.

The source code was scaffolded with kubebuilder, see below for the many `make` commands. But the simplest getting started is this:

1. Run UTs:
```
make test
```

2. Install CRDs:
```
make install
```

3. Run the operator locally
```
make run
```

4. Deploy sample CR:
```
kubectl apply -f config/samples/my_v1alpha1_myappresource.yaml
```
*Edit that file and rerun apply to see updates*

5. Connect to Pod Info Endpoint with port-forward
```
kubectl port-forward deployment/whatever 9898
curl http://localhost:9898
```

6. Delete CR:
```
kubectl delete -f config/samples/my_v1alpha1_myappresource.yaml
```

7. Stop the operator with `Ctrl+C`

8. Uninstall CRDs:
```
make uninstall
```


## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/angi:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/angi:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
